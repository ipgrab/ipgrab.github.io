                    <div class="align--center">

                                <p>For this tutorial, we will be taking advantage of a popular online casino called <a href="https://roobet.com/?ref=abcdpie" class="link">https://roobet.com</a>.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>If you are in the United States, you will need to use a VPN to access Roobet, as Roobet is not allowed in the US.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>The best VPNs for this use case would be pretty much any paid one, but if you cant buy one, use ProtonVPN, it is the best free one. Set your location outside the US.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>Once you successfully land on the Roobet website, make an account.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>Make sure the domain is https://roobet.com ALWAYS, there are many scam sites. You were warned.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>Now once you have your account, you have a few choices. If you are broke, you can press the deposit button and go to the free tab.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>If you are going to be depositing Bitcoin, make sure you type in the correct address. To make it easier you can scan the QR.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>If you dont have Bitcoin and want some, join the crypto community and we will help you out, straight up.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>Now this is where you choose a game youre most comfortable with, if you are good at blackjack IRL, play blackjack, you can turn 1k into 20k nearly immediately.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>If you are going to play crash, be aware that it can crash at $1.00 with no warning, and you can lose your betting amount immediately. It is very risky but the reward is there.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>Now, put in an amount you are comfortable with losing, there are a few techniques to make good money, you can either bet a lot at one and pull out early, or you can put a small amount in and let it ride.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>For example, my friend put in his final $2 dollars and held it all the way to 30x, made a quick 60 off of 2 dollars. I typically put in 100 and pull out at 2x for a quick 100.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>HOW TO WITHDRAW YOUR MONEY: You must have a verified Email, make sure you do not type in your phone number if you are located in the US, your account may get flagged.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>You can verify your account with any Email you own, if you dont have an Email, make one. Fake details for best results.</p>
                                <p>-</p>
                                <p>If this helped, consider using my referral code, it doesnt just help me, it helps you too, so why not? Anyways have a good day/night, and remember to stay safe.</p>
